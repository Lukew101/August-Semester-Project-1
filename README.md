# August-Semester-Project-1

This is my August semester project with Noroff. The task involves obtaining a brief, designing a responsive website and creating it using HTML and CSS.

## Description

This is a responsive web page built for my semester project at Noroff (Netlify link below). For this project, I was required to make a design using Figma for both desktop and mobile viewing (Link to prototypes below). This design was based on a case provided (brief below) with a requirement to develop several key pages listed below. Next, using HTML and CSS, I developed the desktop prototype into a functional and responsive web page.

## Project Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.
